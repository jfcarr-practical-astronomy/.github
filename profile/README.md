# Practical Astronomy

## The Book

You came here for the source code, but everything begins with the book.

My source code implementations could never have been done without the in-depth explanations of the astronomical algorithms contained in "Practical Astronomy with your Calculator or Spreadsheet".

This book, now in its 4th edition (2017), and written by Peter Duffett-Smith and Jonathan Zwart. I _highly_ recommend that you purchase a copy for yourself.

## The Approach

Each of the source code implementations has been built by examining the book's accompanying spreadsheets (and their macros) and translating them to the appropriate programming language.

## The Source Code

If you're interested in a specific language implementation:

Language | Description | Status
---------|-------------|-------
[Python](https://github.com/jfcarr-practical-astronomy/practical-astronomy-python) | Requires Python 3. Depends on the following Python libraries: math, unittest. | Feature Complete
[C#](https://github.com/jfcarr-practical-astronomy/practical-astronomy-dotnet) | Built with .NET 5. There's also a NuGet published [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PracticalAstronomyDotNet/). | Feature Complete
[Rust](https://github.com/jfcarr-practical-astronomy/practical-astronomy-rust) | Uses Rust 2018 features. | Feature Complete
[C++](https://github.com/jfcarr-practical-astronomy/practical-astronomy-cpp) | Built with Clang, following the C++17 standard. | In Progress
[Java](https://github.com/jfcarr-practical-astronomy/practical-astronomy-java) | Built with OpenJDK 11. | In Progress
